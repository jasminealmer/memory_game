Memory Game

****

Improvments that could be applied

Functionality-wise:

1) Shuffle the deck. If the player would like to play memory again (who wouldn't?), then the cards should be shuffled each game to prevent cheeting.

2) Add a time keeper. It would be cool to keep track of speed when playing the game.

3) Some more refactoring of the code could be done, for example break out some functionalities from the two functions to new ones to adhear "low coupling/high cohesion".

Design-wise:

1) I like the simplicity of the design as-is, but the popup for example have potential to improve. It would be nice to have an exit-button, since it could be a bit confusing when closing the popup right now. Also this popup-design makes it hard to create a hover design for the h2 element, this I would've implemented differently when looking at it now.

2) Right now the design does not work when I downsize the webpage.
