Hello Tomas!

I have built a Schmemory based right in the nature, with animals as our play mates. The design and functionality is quite simple since I tried to keep the five hour recommended time limit.

I made two functions in script.js that helps us determine when the player chooses two cards, and whether the chosen cards are a match or not. Please see comments throughout each file to follow how the functionality and design is built.

Design-wise I chose to add an instructions-popup to make the game more user-friendly. Generally I tried to keep it simple and clean, but still use fun colors/pictures. The user group would be players aged 5-10. I tried to use HTML5 rules and I split the different chunks in header, main and footer to make the code easier to read and follow.

Improvments that could be applied

Functionality-wise:

1) Shuffle the deck. If the player would like to play Schmemory again (who wouldn't?), then the cards should be shuffled each game to prevent cheeting.

2) Add a time keeper. It would be cool to keep track of speed when playing the game.

3) Some more refactoring of the code could be done, for example break out some functionalities from the two functions to new ones to adhear "low coupling/high cohesion".

Design-wise:

1) I like the simplicity of the design as-is, but the popup for example have potential to improve. It would be nice to have an exit-button, since it could be a bit confusing when closing the popup right now. Also this popup-design makes it hard to create a hover design for the h2 element, this I would've implemented differently when looking at it now.

2) Right now the design does not work when I downsize the webpage.

Thank you for this opportunity!

Have a great day!

Jasmine
